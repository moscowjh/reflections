## GitHub Reflection

#### How did reviewing a GIF between two versions help you to find a bug?

By very quickly allowing us to identify typos that are clearly unintentional, but which have a direct impact on code quality.

#### Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because GIT is designed to perform version control for projects (repositories) which encompass multiple files which are often changed simultaneously to make a single change.

#### How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

The command `git Log` allows you to see all of the commits for a particular repository.  By doing a `git diff` on any two commit IDs, you can understand the changes that have been made.

`git checkout` - restores files to state when a particular commit was made

#### How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Using version control gives you the ability to roll back any bugs that might be created, so it gives you greater confidence to make changes that will fix issues.

#### Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I have been using `git` minimally, but now want to start using more advanced features.
