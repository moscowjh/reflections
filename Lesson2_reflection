## GitHub Reflection Chapter 2

#### What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git metadata file is created.  Because it is a necessary precondition to `git add`

#### How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It gives you a chance to make sure you have all the directories you need ready to commit and to run some final tests.

####How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can run `git diff` to make verify that you haven't added more changes.
