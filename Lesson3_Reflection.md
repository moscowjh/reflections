#### When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When more than one person is working on the project or when you wanted to use Github to present work to others.

#### Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because as developer, you need to decide when the next logical increment of your project is complete: for instance, if functionality is complete or a bug is fixed.  If changes were pulled automatically, you would likely get changes that would not run properly
