#### When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When more than one person is working on the project or when you wanted to use Github to present work to others.

#### Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because as developer, you need to decide when the next logical increment of your project is complete: for instance, if functionality is complete or a bug is fixed.  If changes were pulled automatically, you would likely get changes that would not run properly

#### Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is a copy of a GIT repository whether that repository is local or remote. A fork is a clone on Github of another Github repo.  When you fork a Github repo, you can change the fork, but not the original without a pull request.  A branch is a copy of a repo that is kept within that repo in order to keep certain changes isolated from each other.

#### What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Enables you to work on merging and reconciling changes even if you are offline.

#### How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I don't think GIT itself has collaboration features. Without pull requests it would be much harder to have others review your code. They would probably have to be done manually.
